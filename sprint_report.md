## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synopsis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't
repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand
how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any
significant learnings for your team.

The team created four new features as well as the general class setup we will be using for the rest of project. We successfully completed our: login, class viewing, menu, and logging features. Setting up the project was the most difficult as we had to decide how the data flow will work down the road as well as what data structures to use and so forth. 

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user
stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward
completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of
acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the
issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate
it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so
that it can be addressed later.

Here are the issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
- We finished all issues we started. However, we did not start the grade assignment issue and create course issue due to time constraints. We did not plan our time correctly and had an unforeseen emergency with one of our teammates.
